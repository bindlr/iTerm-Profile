Goonies fans will agree, this Goonies inspired iTerm2 profile is bad-ass. 


## Required

*1. Download [iTerm2](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli) as a replacement for Terminal. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.*

*2. Install [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) which is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout...*

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Installation

*1. Download this repo and modify the [iterm-profile.json](https://github.com/drewpark88/iTerm-Profile/blob/master/iterm-profile.json). Change "MYUSERNAME" with your computer's username. Also, update the "Working Directory" path if needed.*

*2. Open iTerm2 Preferences -> General, you will notice at the bottom of the panel there is a setting. Load preferences from a custom folder or URL. Use the modified iterm-profile.json file from the last step. There is a button next to it Save settings to Folder.*

Hey, you guuuys! It's free, but first, you gotta do the truffle shuffle.
